# SQL-Automation
 **Project Name:** SQL Automation for Data Governance - CBRE GWS  **Description:**  Welcome to the SQL Automation project I completed during my Data Governance internship at CBRE Global Workplace Solutions. 🌐  **Project Highlights:**  📊 **Objective:** The primary goal of this project was to streamline data management processes within the Data Governance team.  🐍 **Python SQL Automation:** I developed a robust Python-based SQL automation solution using VS Code. This tool establishes direct connections to both MySQL and MS Excel, enabling the team to execute SQL queries and have the results instantly reflected in Excel sheets.  🛠️ **Tool Mastery:** This project allowed me to leverage essential tools like VS Code, Excel, MySQL, and Postgre SQL, demonstrating my ability to work with industry-standard technologies.  📈 **Library Integration:** To optimize functionality, I integrated the Pandas Python library, SQL database connectors, and the openpyxl library. These additions enhanced data processing capabilities and facilitated efficient data governance.  This project not only showcases my technical skills but also underscores my commitment to improving data governance processes. Feel free to explore the code and reach out for any inquiries or potential collaborations. 🚀  #DataGovernance #SQLAutomation #Python #CBRE #Internship
